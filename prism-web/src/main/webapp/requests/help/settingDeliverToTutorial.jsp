                <p>
                We have recently changed the way you set the deliver-to information.  If you attended any of the 
                training sessions on the system, you know that the system used to have concepts of "personal" and "global" 
                Address Books.  When submitting a request, you would choose an entry either from your personal address
                book, the MDH-wide "global" address book, or you could just type in an address.    
                </p>
                <p>
                The address book concept turned out to be overly complicated and error-prone.  We made the decision to simplify
                the process as much as possible.  Now, when you first access the checkout page, 
                the system will attempt to default the deliver-to information to your primary location, which is based on your 
                primary job/position at MDH.  If we do not have that information in our database, the Mailing Address field
                will be blank.  However, the system will not allow you to submit a request without providing a mailing address.  
                </p>
                <p>
                So what do you do when your default mailing address is blank, or if you want your request shipped to another
                MDH employee?  In this case, you would click the Change Delivery Info
                button.  The system will present a form where you will choose a recipient and location.  The first field that 
                you should set is the Organization.  If you choose MDH, you will be present with a list of MDH employees and a 
                list of MDH Facilities.  Simply find your name in that list (or the name of the MDH employee you want the stuff
                sent to), and then choose the facility.   Finally, click the Done button to return to the checkout page.  The 
                system will automatically fill in the mailing address based on the facility you chose.  
                </p>
                <p>
                What if you want your request shipped to someone in an external organization?  Again, click the Change Delivery Info
                button to access the delivery detail form.  Find the external organization's name in the organization drop-down.  Once
                you select an organization from the drop-down, the system will refresh the Recipient list so that it only includes 
                names of people associated with the selected organization.  If we have no people associated with the selected organization
                in our database, the system will display a message "No contacts on file for this organization."  If you can, 
                choose a name from the list or, if the person you had in mind is not in the list, leave it blank.  The system will also display 
                a list of addresses that we have on file for the selected organization.  Choose an address, and then click the Done button.  
                </p>
                <p>
                What if you can't find the organization, contact, or mailing address you need?  We are working on providing a simple and 
                intuitive way for you to enter new data for each of these fields as needed, while making sure to prevent the entry of 
                redudant/duplicate data.  Until that feature is ready, you can email the information you need to 
                <a href="mailto:health.ISTMHELPDESK@state.mn.us">health.ISTMHELPDESK@state.mn.us</a> and we will enter it
                into the database manually. Please set your email's subject line to &quot;Add Delivery Address Data to PRISM&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
